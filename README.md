Crew Portal
A Department-Segregated HR & Employee Self-Service Platform. Secure. Streamlined. Unified.
Crew Portal is a holistic web application built to solve the core security and efficiency problems in modern HR management. It is built on a single, powerful principle: strict departmental data segregation, ensuring that HR administrators can only access and manage data for employees within their assigned department.

1. Problem Statement
Current HR systems are fundamentally broken, causing pervasive issues:

a.High Security Risk: HR staff have excessive access to sensitive data from all departments.
b.Operational Inefficiency: Managers rely on a messy mix of spreadsheets and emails for core tasks.
c.Poor Employee Experience: Simple self-service actions are confusing and frustrating for employees.
d.Lack of Insight: It's nearly impossible to get real-time, department-specific reports.

2. Our Solution
Crew Portal solves these problems by providing a single, unified system with two distinct interfaces:

1.The Crew HR Portal: A command center for departmental HR managers, providing a full suite of tools strictly confined to their own team's data.
2.The Crew Employee Dashboard: A secure self-service hub where employees can manage their personal data, tasks, leave, and finances, with zero visibility into any other colleague's information.
